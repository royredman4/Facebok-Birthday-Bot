This is a general program that says a happy birthday message to a user whose birthday it is that day. If there are no birthdays that day, the program will close. This program requires a file named "Birthday Messages.txt" that would have each birthday message in there (each message is separated by a new line). It will also require a username and password, where you can manually input yourself if desired. 

You may need to install the following packages first before running the program: 

Selenium 

PhantomJS (http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

Chromedriver (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chromedriver_installer)

Once that is installed, you may run it as you please. 

Also, if you want to see it running with your eyes in a browser, comment the following line 

"driver = webdriver.PhantomJS(desired_capabilities = headers)" 

and uncomment the line before it ("driver = webdriver.Chrome()"). 

This will allow you to see the program running using the chrome browser. 

ENJOY!!
